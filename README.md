# Large Integer Operations in C++ 

This repository contains three C++ files that together are designed to handle a variety of operation procedures involving very large integers. Emphasizing on addition and multiplication, these files work seamlessly with extremely large numbers, regardless of their count.

Here is a snapshot of the repository content:

## Mult.cpp
The "Mult.cpp" file defines multiplication operations specifically designed to support a vast range of large integers, regardless of their count.

## Operation.cpp
Serving as a backbone for the operation procedures, the "Operation.cpp" file outlines a common definition that other operations conform to, which includes the operations specified in "Mult.cpp" and "Sum.cpp."

## Sum.cpp
The "Sum.cpp" file contains the addition operations, which is capable of efficiently handling the summation of an unlimited number of extremely large integers.
